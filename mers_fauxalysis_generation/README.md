# Main Idea
This is a set of scripts that I used to generate the fauxalysis data for the MERS docking project.
The idea is simple - copy fragalysis ligands into MERS structures and then relax them with HYBRID.

# Notes
decided not to add this stuff to the main repo because the schematization of the repo will make it much simpler to do
this in the future

however I wanted to save this somewhere in the meantime

One main thing to note is that I think the implementation I used here was based on a version of the docking protocol
that first prepares a set of CSVs as inputs to the docking? And I'm not sure how to reproduce that simply.
